# Renju game schedule

## Week 1:
        * Project game UI (graphical, console versions); choose instrument pack
        * Determine game state data format
        * Decompose software architecture
        * Create debug interface to communicate with a model (light console version, try to implement console game board displaying)
        * Create game engine
        * Prepare dummy architecture components (this way we will have working prototype of a model; constant prediction)

**Remark:** (TOTHINK) Implement game engine in python (++); we are going to implement graphical UI in C# or similar lang.
