# Renju game schedule

## Week 1:
        * Project game UI (graphical, console versions); choose instrument pack
        * Determine game state data format
        * Decompose software architecture
        * Create debug interface to communicate with a model
        (light console version, try to implement console
        game board displaying)
        * Create game engine
        * Prepare dummy architecture components
        (this way we will have working prototype of a model;
        constant prediction)

**TOTHINK:** Implement game engine in python (++); we are going to implement graphical UI in C# or similar lang.
